# Giovanni Misitano, PhD
We have all kinds of fancy AI tools that can predict this and that, but are
complete black-boxes for a layman. When it comes to making actual decisions
based on the output of these tools, we lack decision-support and grounds to
justify our solutions. My research can help us make informed and explicable
decisions when multiple conflicting criteria are to be considered without a
clear 'best' solution. I am all about providing support and tools to decision
makers (domain experts) to make the best possible decisions given their
expertise, preferences, and the available data and information. I do not care
much about replacing human decision makers, but I do think we can do a much
better job at supporting decision makers across a plethora of different domains,
without relying on black-boxes.

**Stop guessing and start optimizing—and do it explainably!**

## About me
I am currently employed as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of
Jyväskylä, Finland, in the Multiobjectove Optimization Group. I specialize in
methods and tools for multiobjective optimization. These methods can be applied
anywhere where data is available, there are conflicting objectives to be
optimized, and there are decision makers with relevant domain expertise.  That
is, pretty much anywhere these days! My current work focuses on researching
decision support tools, more specifically, interactive multiobjective
optimization methods, that are explainable and transparent to decision makers
and stakeholders alike. I also have a deep interest in developing user
interfaces, and the user experience in general from a cognition perspective. 

I am also a main contributor and maintainer of DESDEO. DESDEO is an open-source
Python framework for interactive multiobjective optimization. Our research group
is currently overhauling the framework, working towards a ''DESDEO 2.0.'' This
version will be a full-stack solution, with a backend containing the algorithmic
implementations of various interactive multiobjective optimization methods, both
multi-criteria decision-making methods and stochastic evolutionary methods; an
web application programming interface (API) with database and user session
management to connect the backend over the web to existing and custom
interfaces; and a frontend, a graphical web-based interface designed by us.
This is a huge endeavor, but it is fueled by our group's decased of collective
experience in researching and developing multiobjective optimization methods.

DESDEO can offer huger opportunities in the future for academics and industry in
the future for tackling data-based problems with multiple and conflicting
objectives functions to be either minimized or maximized. DESDEO can very much
function as the connecting piece between all the fancy AI tools available these
days, and making actual decisions based on the tools' output.

Check out the development of the new version of DESDEO [here](https://github.com/industrial-optimization-group/DESDEO/tree/desdeo2).
In the documentation, there is also a primer on what multiobjective optimization is,
check the primer [here](https://desdeo.readthedocs.io/en/desdeo2/tutorials/moo_primer/).

!!! note

    Everything under the `desdeo2` branch is under active development and subject to sudden, and
    possibly drastic, changes. We will release a more stable version going into the latter half
    of the year 2024.
