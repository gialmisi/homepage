# Giovanni Misitano, PhD
We have all kinds of fancy AI tools that can predict this and that, but these
tools are complete black-boxes from the perspective of most decision makers, and
humans general. When it comes to making actual decisions based on the output
of these tools, we lack decision-support and grounds to justify our solutions.
My research can help us make informed and explicable decisions when multiple
conflicting criteria are to be considered without a clear 'best' solution. I am
all about providing support and tools to decision makers (domain experts) to
make the best possible decisions given their expertise, preferences, and the
available data and information. I do not care much about replacing human
decision makers, but I do think we can do a much better job at supporting
decision makers across a plethora of different domains, without having to rely
on complete black-boxes.

**Stop guessing and start optimizing—and do it explainably!**

## About me
I am currently employed as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of
Jyväskylä, Finland, in the Multiobjectove Optimization Group led by Professor
Kaisa Miettinen. I specialize in methods and tools for multiobjective
optimization. These methods can be applied anywhere where data is available,
there are conflicting objectives to be optimized, and there are decision makers
with relevant domain expertise.  That is, pretty much anywhere these days! My
current work focuses on researching decision support tools, more specifically,
interactive multiobjective optimization methods, that are explainable and
transparent to decision makers and stakeholders alike. I also have a deep
interest in developing user interfaces, and the user experience in general from
a cognitive perspective. 

I am also a main contributor and maintainer of DESDEO. DESDEO is an open-source
Python framework for interactive multiobjective optimization. Our research group
is currently overhauling the framework, working towards a ''DESDEO 2.0.'' This
version will be a full-stack solution, with a backend containing the algorithmic
implementations of various interactive multiobjective optimization methods, both
multi-criteria decision-making methods and stochastic evolutionary methods; a
web application programming interface (API) with database and user session
management to connect the backend over the web to existing and custom
interfaces; and a frontend, a graphical web-based interface designed by us.
This is a huge endeavor, but it is fueled by our research group's decades of collective
experience in researching and developing multiobjective optimization methods.

In the future, DESDEO will offer huge opportunities in academia and industry for
tackling data-based problems with multiple and conflicting objectives functions
to be either minimized or maximized simultaneously. DESDEO can very much
function as the connecting piece between all the fancy AI tools available these
days, and the act of making actual decisions based on these tools' output.

Check out the development of the new version of DESDEO
[here](https://github.com/industrial-optimization-group/DESDEO/tree/desdeo2).
In the documentation, there is also a primer on what multiobjective optimization
is, check the primer
[here](https://desdeo.readthedocs.io/en/desdeo2/tutorials/moo_primer/).

!!! note

    Everything under the `desdeo2` branch is under active development and subject to sudden, and
    possibly drastic, changes. We will release a more stable version going into the latter half
    of the year 2024.
