      I am in charge of one of the three work packages of the project. In the
      work package, I continue to research the concept and application of
      explainable and interactive multiobjective optimization, a topic I
      explored in my doctoral thesis.

      I kept contributing to the DESDEO framework, focusing on the development
      of web-based user interfaces for interactive multiobjective optimization.
      The work led to publications, where the interfaces have been utilized to
      conduct user studies to evaluate the decision-support capabilities of
      various interactive multiobjective optimization methods.  I also
      contributed to studies related to lot-sizing, and researching the semantic
      distances of icons in user interfaces for interactive multiobjective
      optimization methods.

      I contributed to the DESDEO framework, spearheading its re-implementation.
      I focused on the tools to model multiobjective optimization problems, and 
      on implementing scalarization-based interactive multiobjective optimization methods.

      I am working in the Research Council of Finland funded project DESIDES.
      My main research interest is continuing the line of work I established in
      my doctoral thesis, where I study and apply the concept of explainability
      in interactive multiobejective optimization methods.
  - position: Doctoral Researcher

      Working on my doctoral thesis and developing the DESDEO framework.  My
      thesis work was about applying and exploring the concept of
      explainability, as it is known in explainable artificial intelligence, to
      interactive multiobjective optimization methods. The goal of the research
      was to improve the decision-support capabilities of interactive
      multiobjective optimization methods.

      I worked on building deep neural networks to predict particle
      trajectories in the CMS (*compact muon solenoid*) detector.
      I utilized Keras to build and train a deep convoluted neural
      network, and utilized real experiment data to train the model
      utilizing supervised learning.

      In the C14 experiment, I worked on signal analysis of data produced by
      photo-multiplier tubes, and conducted practical hands-on work with
      various apparatuses related to the experiment. In the EMMA experiment, I
      worked one basic upkeep and maintenance work, including the
      setup of a working gas circulation system for a set of pixel matrix
      detectors utilizing very limited resources.

      I was part of the DAMA collaboration. I worked on the maintenance of
      various experiments in the DAMA project. I also completed a project
      involving computer vision and machine learning, where I built a program to
      read the output of a webcam and infer the digits on a 8-segment
      temperature gauge.
